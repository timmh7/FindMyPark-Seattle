This is a project I built to help people explore Seattle's incredible park system! With over 400 parks in the city, I wanted to create a tool that makes it easy to find the perfect outdoor space - whether you're looking for a dog-friendly spot, a place to hike, or just a local quiet park to relax.

I also integrated an AI-powered park guide that lets you describe what you're looking for in plain language, and it will suggest parks that match your needs. Give it a try! ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²
