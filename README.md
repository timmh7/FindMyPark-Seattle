This is a project is intended to help people explore Seattle's vast park system and greenspaces! Seattle has over 400 official public parks; as such I created a tool that makes it easy to find the perfect outdoor space - whether you're looking for a dog-friendly spot, a place to hike, or just a local quiet park to relax.

Integrated with an AI-powered park guide that lets you describe what you're looking for in plain language, and it will suggest parks that match your needs! ðŸŒ²
